            "explanations": {"b":"The ALU is primarily based on combinational logic, which means its outputs depend only on the current input values and not on any previous inputs or the internal state of the circuit. Combinational logic circuits are built using logic gates which can be interconnected to perform complex operations. The ALU uses these logic gates to implement various arithmetic operations."},
